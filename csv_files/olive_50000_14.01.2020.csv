Now for Exempt items where there is NO tax ( like export sea and air freight and related all surcharges ), they are maintaining one series and issuing BILL OF SUPPLY with no GST

For all other cases like normal taxable charges - invoice to SEZ party with or without GST - invoice to export parties ( outside india like nepal / Bhutan or any foreign country ) etc they are generating
TAX INVOICE and maintaining separate invoice numbering series for same.

We have been suggested by our consultant to start similar process for all our companies and accordingly, we would like to do same procedure of maintaining 2 series one for exempt items and other for taxable
items.

We propose following -

All activity and process of Invoice generation to remain same, only at the time of inserting invoice by software, the system will check the charges in particular bill of lading and will automatically segregate
the charges between exempt and other charges and will generate one TAX Invoice for taxable items and another BILL OF SUPPLY for exempt items with diff invoicing series.

Please get this done on top most priority basis.

Also similar option we need to have in FAS under menu OTHER INVOICES where u need to provide us with new menu to generate BILL OF SUPPLY and credit for for BILL of SUPPLY.

This also needs changes in GSTR1 report generation, the bill of supply should be separately mentioned under GSTR1 report which is getting generated. The present series what we are mentioning for Security
deposit is diff series and should not form part of GSTR1 reporting.

Please get us with timeline of doing this changes and expected delivery date.

Dear KK Sir,

With reference to the below shipment details, The system is showing correct GST number (30AACCS1421J2ZW)
in the final invoice screen but when we will make the supplementary invoice, by default system is showing wrong GST number (24AAACH2736F1Z0).

As per logic, By default supplementary invoice should show the final invoice information or data i.e. Customer SFC, Place of Supply and GST number).

Please check and confirm. Please find the below details.

From system yard master, how to identify empty depot.

According to us, there is need of making one check box

Hope our requirement is clear, you can do it far better way than suggested. In case of any queries, please feel free to call and discuss before making any changes.

Dear Team,

Good Day To You !!

Please help in sorting out error pertaining to TicketE1525

We need to modify 2 invoices for BL CKYMUNJEA00046 & CKYMUNSAA00029

Please change the rate particulars as BAF Charges i/o Surcharge in both the invoices, removing the GST therein.

Attached invoices for your reference.

Kindly advice on priority as the client needs BL today and needs to make payment on basis of the invoice.

Thanking You,

Dear,
In two cases comments are WILL BE DELIVERED ON OR BEFORE 22-DEC-2018, we are in 20th January, 2019. 
It is evident that eBMS has not considered the snag list in seriousness. Manual is also pending for years.
Kindly confirm that either you clear the snag list in Chennai in two days or if required let your personnel come to
our office and compete the snag list.
We are embarrassed to point out these often to you and remind you of your professional ethics. Your personnel were
in Mumbai in January2019, and did not have the courtesy to call us or visit our office to ensure that the problems are solved.
Hope with all seriousness and professional ethics you will deliver the pending items within two days..

Thanks & Regards,
Shankar.

Dear EBMS Team,

Good Day !!

For subject BL, the description being too long does not fit the common description and has been taken on rider sheet.

In taking the rider print, there is a pop up which says description of more than 3000 characters is not permitted.

Hence, we have adjusted it on the first page which is exceeding the column length.

Dear EBMS Team,

Good Day !!

For subject BL, we are unable to generate receipt of full amount i.e. INR 56595.75

The invoice of subject BL is subject to rebate of USD 55.

However, due to the new system, the rate does not reflect rebate and hence the invoice was edited to include Rebate on Freight.

The invoice is made of full amount i.e. INR 56595.75 and the system reflects Invoice amount of INR 44621.7 (deducting rebate)

The receipt hence shows amount of INR 44621.7 (excluding rebate) and not the full amount.

Kindly advice. Below screenshot foryour reference and attached Invoice

Thanking You,

With Regards,

Juhi Sawlani

In addition to above, there is also change in Import EDI structure, Customs has proposed various fields and in response shipping association and proposed to Customs the fields to be Mandatory
/ Optional / Not Applicable.. as of now the EDI structure not yet finalise and same under course of discussion.. will share the EDI structure received via separate mail.

Have generated the ticket ID for said task as - E2767.

Hope you must have received request from your other vendor for incorporation of revise EDI in system, as EDI will be common for all..so please kindly initiate the task and update us before

Dear Vishram,

When we migrated from Service Tax to GST, we have changed the

Final Bill concept to Credit Note/Debit Note concept.

i.e. instead of Final Bill , eBMS will generate a Credit Note

for the amount refundable to the Importer or a Debit Note

for the amount collectable from the Importer.

This difference will happen normally on the following heads:

Port Storage

Detention

Damage

Any other charges waived by the Principals.

Cr/Dr Note is to be raised on the above heads.

There is no new calculation involved compared to Final Bill concept.

Shocked to understand that the Cr/Dr notes not calculated/generated

by eBMS but are done manually.

Can you please look into this and resolve the issue.

If need be, we can have a concall.

Thanks and Regards.

Mahesh.

Dear KK,

Please note that the FIRST CELL of Daily Collection Report under column VOUCHER NO. (highlighted in yellow in the attached Daily collection file) comes blank due to which the invoice numbers
which are pertaining to column LINE BL NUMBER are shifted one row down and it continues till the end of the report. Below is the screen shot and we have also attached Daily collection report of 11.03.19

Example : Against B/L no. MA001860 correct 3 invoices are 455400068, 456854143 and 455569899 but if you will see in the report invoice no. 455569899 is seen against B/L no. AN000480

Accordingly against next B/L no. AN000480 correct invoice no. is 455569948 but if you will see in the report invoice no. 455569899 is seen against this B/L no. AN000480 which is actually invoice
of B/L MA001860

This data is very important as the CSV file which will be generated with this Daily Collection Report for Automated data transfer from EBMS TO DACS should be accurate ie. correct invoice numbers
should be reflected against corresponding B/L numbers. Please check this part also.

Please look into this issue and resolve it as soon as possible.

Dear Olive / Karuna Sir,

We generated and printed the attached invoice in test server. This alignment is OK now. 

The below points from snag list were pending because of PDF invoice alignment. Please confirm if now we can move
them to live environment. 

Sr. no.

eDAC Transfer issues:

1

Hamburg Sd name change

2

There must be no difference between generating and printing (eDAC transfer) of an invoice or credit note.

3

Debit & Credit note must be printed directly into a PDF without display on screen.

4

Standalone invoice module 

Best Regards

Dear Karuna

Inter branch credit note of other invoice need to have filter means if we are in mumbai location ebms should prompt if we are passing credit note of other invoices of other than in mumbai branch.

In above case other invoice of mumbai but we passed credit note in mundra by ebms module ""..eBMS Solutions Pvt Ltd..

and credit note no also generated in mundra location. In this case system should not allow to pass such entry.

Dear Olive/ Srinath,

I am yet to receive your feedback on below points.

In chargewise summary, INR figures for Freight, baf, ISPS etc are not reflecting.
For Collect figures - Is it possible to show INR figures separately by converting USD into INR.Can you set two dialogue box named as freight tax rate and freight tax amount so that if i put the freight tax rate 3.1824% it should automatically calculate the freight tax amount (freight tax will be calculated on last column ""Total (INR)"" + Collect
Charge converted INR figure)

there is already provision in PBK to select ineligible ITC while passing PBK and user is selecting same as well but system is not posting reversal entry nor marking same as in eligible GST in GSTR2

please refer today's mail of Sanjay from A'bad office on same matter referring to PBK in which this was done.

We need to get this sorted out as this is giving us too much trouble while preparing data for GSTR2 and annual return

Dear Olive,

Find bellow points noticed from checking BOOKING REPORT, Please do needful and Update ASAP.

1) On Voyage text box Ajax Listing All the voyages created from all the locations for that vessel. Should be location wise.

2) In the generated report, Instead of 20 & 40 all the container type need to mention.

3) Details for Bookings with Multiple container type are wrong in the generated report. Only one container type is showing in the generated report.

Eg:- Booking No: CKYDXB1900335

Two Container types are there in this booking, 3x20HD and 2x40HC

In the generated report above only HD20 Details are showing 40 Details are missing. Please check and do needful.

4) For multiple container type Booking rate also need to mention container type wise currently only one Rate is listing.

5) Total is Zero in the generated Report,

6) In location its listing Abu Dhabi also in Dubai Location. Abu Dhabi is Different Agent.

Dear Karuna

Refer to our yesterday discussion, presently while generating receipts we are having provision to update TDS. This process is working fine without any issues. 
In this process, all TDS (irrespective of Principal or Agency) is booked under particular account in FAS. Now we want to separate the same as we want to know how much TDS was deducted against
agency income so that we can claim the same. With current process, same cannot be identified from FAS.

We suggest to provide two TDS options while generating receipts as below

TDS on principal chargesTDS on agency charges

Kindly check the possibility and confirm us.

Dear KK

At the time of GST implementation, the point was raise that once GST Return done for the month then no body can raise the Invoice & no body can pass the entry in back dated.

As discussed, pls check below mail send to Chennai Branch. Invoice for Jun 19 month but user by mistake post the same in Apr 19

Now we require the POP UP for the user if curunt invoice he is posting in back dated.

Then we can avoid these type of error.

Pls check & confirm.

Dear Karuna,

Noted Bellow thanks. Need some changes in report as bellow. Updated in eTMS  ID E21
This three columns EST PAY OUT, EST BILL OUT, EST MARGIN, need to remain as same values as per the time of Job Opening

Need to add three more columns to the report.

1) Actual Bill Out 

2) Actual Pay Out

3) Actual Margin

A) Actual Bill Out

In Actual Bill Out column, if the invoice generated then the value should be the invoice value. If the invoice not generated then Zero.

B) Actual Pay Out

In Actual Pay Out column, total of the payment requests Approved till date of report generation.

C) Actual Margin

In Actual Margin column, Difference of Actual Bill out and Actual Pay out.

Eg: 

a) If Actual Bill out 1000.00 & Actual Pay out 500.00
then Actual Margin will be 500.00

b) If Actual Bill out 0.00 & Actual Pay out 500.00
then Actual Margin will be -500.00 (Invoice not generated)

c) If Actual Bill out 1000.00 & Actual Pay out 0.00
then Actual Margin will be 1000.00 (Purchase not booked)

Dear guys,

in order to finalize the eBMS invoice file naming topic at our end I need to have clarification about
the possible different naming conventions.
Initially Archana and Heiko requested following possible combinations:

<BL name_FRT> 
<BL name_LC1>
<BL name_LC2>
<BL name_LC3>
<BL name_FRTC> 
<BL name_LC1C>
<BL name_LC2C>
<BL name_LC3C>

e.g. 
SUDU87830A2KQ003_FRT : Freight Invoice 
SUDU87830A2KQ003_LC1 : Local Charge Invoice
SUDU87830A2KQ003_LC1C : Local Charge Invoice Credit Note

This is not 100% compatible with the below offered test data.
There are e.g. following combinations:
201906241247_455_450900_SUDU19001A5M5003_CNFRT1
201906241219_455_540104_SUDUA9GDY001494X_CNLC4

Could you please provide an overview of the different combinations possible in eBMS?
Thanks.

Dear Karuna/Noor, 

Draft BL created and confirmed as POD & FD Colombo, Sri Lanka

Attached draft bl and final bl for ur ref. 

Since this is LC shipment and bank rejected the BL due to this issue, customer requested to reprint the new set
of BL with correct POD & FD.

Requesting you to please add serial no. for 3 OBL and 3 Non nego to reprint new set of BL.

Dear EBMS Team,

Good Morning !!

We are facing below issues in posting the Manifest for subject shipment.

1. Rate of 01 x FR 40 container type is not reflecting, only War Surcharge is reflecting. RR No. 1767 fyr.

2. Instead of Name of rate component i.e. War Risk Surcharge, its code is reflecting in the Freight Type for both the BLs.

Kindly do the needful at the earliest to post the Manifest for subject vessel.

Thanking You,

With Regards,

Dear Pravin / eBMS team,

We hv dispute in calculating freight commission due to different freight details in our manifest compared with Ceekay manifest print out.
Attached is our freight manifest when posted to POD (JKT_EXPORT MANIFESTS) vs Ceekay print out (MANIFEST.zip) for your investigation.

For example : CKYJKTMUA02065 & CKYJKTMAA02082 when posted on 03/May freight manifest only shown OFT.
However, as per screen system, freight manifest hv breakdown with OFT + SC.

CKYJKTMAA02082 :

CKYJKTSIN01668, freight manifest posted on 21/Mar only mentioned THC + OFT ( total USD. 795) while system read as THC + OFT + OS ( total USD.650) ??

The dispute is not only for export but also for import which we yet attach the manifest.
Please check & advise.

Currently combined BL wise data is appearing.

3) Units exported total nos required at the end of report .

4) Please check the exchange rate is taken four decimals in all container types. In some it is rounded off to two decimals

5) As discuss on conf call, label change in reports heading from Freight / Chgs prepaid and Freight/ Chgs collect to Freight/ Chgs collect at POL and Freight / Charges
at POD.

6) Bill: CKYJEANSA02455 (collect shipment)

a) POD surcharges/ other recovery column not inserted so far. Already informed on our conf call with mujib.

7) Transhipment import & export PDA pending

8) Export empty PDA still not available.

7) POL surcharges/ other recovery column not inserted so far. This column is preferred
for our information. 

8) some destination agents commission is chargeable on full freight (ocean freight & surcharge)
here commission payable logic would be two times commission on basic freight.

Logic transhipment B/L (dot B/L) both ports under same agent. comming in two line one with dot(.)

10) Multiple container type Freight not calculated properly. Single type container its correct
for multiple type container freight is calculated on basic freight + surcharge of some type.

B/L : CKYNSAJEA02426 .

Total Freight should be 940.5 as RR but on report showing 1503.00 which is OT20 Freight + Surcharge + OT freight only. Logic need to streamline where more that one type of container is there.

Dear EBMS Team,

Good Day To You !!

For subject shipment, we have generated the Original Tax Invoice.

However, due to some system error, the Exchange Rate in Detention and Seal Charges have changed in the Original Invoice, different from the Proforma Invoice.

Kindly correct the Original Invoices based on the Proforma Invoice and please make sure such errors do not happen in future.

Thanking You,

With Regards,

DearSir,

Here it is single container only and it should be calculated based in GLD date only.

Also if every time different date is reflected in DO, there will be confusion as to which is the correct date. We cannot check every time in other system (GAUS) for confirmation. So we need free days as per
GLD only.

If it does not pick correct date at top, detention is reflected in invoice every time while preparing final invoice.

Dear Noor, Karuna

The error which occurred in the subject Import manifest showing Freight collect amount of USD 39k in Import manifest
against actual export freight manifest of USD 5,555/ collect at POD has been corrected now.
Thanks for the same.

Pls explore and find out the reason for this error occurring. Your logic that manifest must have been changed/altered
after export port posting is not acceptable. POD or POL cannot change manifests after posting.
My main concern is that this cannot happen as per system logic and we need to establish the reason why this event
happened to ensure permanent fix.

Dear Harsh bhai,

The Subject report is checked following points observed and suggested for corrections and additions.

Find the attached format of Line PDA generated for the month of July 2019 in Excel format for your perusal.

1) The Freight "" to collect at FOD"" need to be placed besides the Freight Prepaid Column . Currently it is been placed after LTHC / DTH recovery. ( suggested for Modification )

2) Line operator Description and Slot cost columns need to be included... Currently it is not been considered.  KK has discussed the point with Bharat bhai and confirmed that it will be included as advised by him.

3) Total no of containers and the container type columns need to be included.

4) Individual vessel data accuracy is due for checking which I will confirm you in due course.

This is for your information.

Dear KK / Olive,

Please refer to the below email from our Ahmedabad office where same invoice number repeats. In the below case due to double THC
invoicing we generated a credit note for the original invoice and then made a new invoice with correct amount but same invoice number was picked for all 3 ie. original invoice, credit note and new invoice. As you are aware same numbers are not accepted in GST
portal when we upload the data. 

Request you to kindly check this case and let us know the reason why same numbers are picked and how we can avoid such case in future.

Best Regards

Dear KK / Olive,

This is another case where same invoice numbers are repeated 5 times (below screen shot invoice no. 455402180).
Kindly check the below screen shot and advise on the below points so these queries dont repeat in future. 

1. Please let us know the reason for same number repeating
many times. Actually the invoice numbers shouldnt repeat

2. Against credit note no. 455402181 amount reflecting
on the screen is Rs. 65502/- but on the invoice it is showing correctly as Rs. 68653.80 due to which there is a difference of Rs. 3151.80 in the below screen. (highlighted in yellow)

3. Transportation invoice for Rs. 11564 is not transferred
to DACS (highlighted in green)

4. In one credit note GST amount figures are different
and also the total (circled in red in invoices attached)

Dear Ebms team,

We realized that CRO font presentation is rather small & less spacious compared with font at Booking as attached sample.
In past experience, we had issue with our depo who were not able to read remarks for cntr released nos. because of the font
size is too small.

Just wondering if there is anyway to make CRO font more presentable or adjust the size bigger as it is with Booking.
Thank you.

Dear Rajeesh & team,

RR #2112 (volume expected = 2) will be inserted for bkg no. CKYJKT1900037 & CKYJKT1900038 @ 1x40OH OT.
However, below pop up when I change quantity in bkg from 2 into 1 .

We insert new RR #2112 due to shipper picked up 40OH instead of 40OT ( RR #2066 )
Kindly check & advise.

Thank you.

Dear Noor,

Today I have tried the Expenses booking for Mumbai Location.... we have noticed few points as given below.

When we select the entries from EBMS FAS system for SOA submission, The total of the entry selected should be available to cross verify the total import / export SOA entry submitted under SOA AGENT REQUEST.
.
2) We have observed that the exchange rate format not common against all the entries selected...

3) We generated the Excel format report from FAS system which is not opening and the report generation also takes more time. Refer the attached excel sheet .

4) you can also refer the import export expense entry due for approval from Agency module.

5) Further the entries with dummy vessels need to be considered as general expenses as they are non vessel related expenses...

can you keep the option of General also for the expenses having dummy vessel voyages.

Await your comment on above points.

I have generated the report of Line PDA for the month of Aug 2019 and the Agency Export PDA for August.... I have checked the Agents PDA in comparison with Line pda for all Indian Ports.

1) The correction for Basic OCF+ other Surcharges = Total Freight and Inter change of Column is done from your end -----

 Checked and figures are ok. Columns are OK.

2) The Quantity ( Total no of 20'+ 40' and total Teus ) as per Agency PDA matches with Line PDA. ( Individually checked with each agency PDA )

3) Total Freight ( Basic ocf+ Other charges ) matches with Line PDA

4) Load port THC --- Does not matches with Line PDA... The reason might due to logic variance.. In Agency PDA THC billing is considered as base for LTHC updation and in Lines PDA the LTHC picked up from Templete... Each agency there is difference...

5) In Line PDA, For the Load port Kolkatta the LTHC and the Cost are not converted in to USD... The INR figure is placed under USD column which I have explained you in Any desk demo... Still not cleared. please look in to it.

6) For Hazira Port , as the THC recovery and Cost was not updated by us Hence the LTHC column and THC Cost column shown as Zero...

I am forwarding you the revised THC templete updated with Hazira port THC recovery and cost.... Kindly upload the revised thc tariff templete. Upon your confirmation I shall recheck the same...

Thanks and regards

Dear Noor Sir,

As per discussion with you, we are facing issue in printing BL as draft is different and Original BL is different.

When we select Rider sheet option then on draft Clauses appear but on final BL clauses not reflect(attached draft and original BL copy).When we do not select rider sheet option then on draft full description reflect but on original BL no description appear(attached draft and BL copy)

Please resolve this issue and update as we need to release BL today, draft and original BL should be same.

Thanks and Best Regards,

Dear Olive

Shipment arrived in July 2019 and cleared in 5/10/2019.

Line approved 10% discount.

Earlier 2 invoice generated basis normal 14 days free and credit note passed for 10% discount.

In between user updated 10% discount and generated invoice basis 10% discount, due to which there was error in calculation and could not get correct amount.

We calculated detention manually as below :-

Dear KK,

As discussed Earlier Line PDA generation is taking too much time, most of the cases its fail to generate the Report. Entire line module got stuck while generating Line PDA.
For checking Generated line PDA BL wise and Vessel Wise for the period of 01 July to 31 July.

Bellow Miss matches in Line PDA, please check whether the logic applied is correct line PDA and other reports.
As per Loading Report -Line Laden Loaded for the month of July is 590 units, Line PDA Total Laden is 599 Units
As per Empty Loading Report- Line  Empty loaded for the month of July is 426 Units, Line PDA total Empty 99 Units
As per Loading Report -Line total number of BLs are for month of July is 237 BLs, Line PDA total count is 242 BLs

Transhipment Case : THC recovery showing Wrong. need to correct the logic for Transshipments.

Eg Case
BL: CKYNSASOH02585 Vessel : XIAMEN voyage: 1006E CKS
Discharge Port THC showing as 14954.60, thats wrong.

Dear EBMS Team,

In menu Export Freight List Dtl (Manifest) on top of the report ""Location"" column by default it's coming as Mumbai for every location, whereas report should have respective location name.As THC charges are in INR, so in chargewise summary INR figure is reflecting but is it possible to reflect the equivalent USD figure also?Can you set two dialogue box named as freight tax rate and freight tax amount so that if I put the freight tax rate as 3.1824% it should automatically calculate the freight tax amount as below (freight tax will be calculated on last column ""Total (INR)""
+ Collect Charge converted into INR figure)

7.5% OF GROSS AMOUNT

   Total (INR) + Collect Charge converted into INR figure

Basic Tax payable on the Income @ 40%

40% on above

Surcharge on Tax @ 2%

2% on above 

Health & Edu CESS 4%

4% on Basic Tax + Surcharge

Dear Karuna

Good Morning.

Please note below message from Reliance, stating invoice amount should exact match with GSTR1.
Vendor payment will be released only if invoices provided to them matches exactly with invoices uploaded on GST portal.

Here we found discrepancy as EBMS invoice value doesnt match with GSTR1. GSTR1 generated from EBMS round offs Taxable amount. 
For e.g. total amount of invoice no. BOMEX2190900260 is 130800.64 where as GSTR1 total comes to 130800.78. Difference of 14 paise. This discrepancy is due to rounding off taxable
amount in GSTR1.

Kindly fix this issue at the earliest and confirm.

Dear Karuna,

Ref to our discussion earlier, in manifest generation in export and import manifest print need to add lease type of the particular container, taken from the container master from Line module.
Only lease type SOC and COC need to mention in the manifest. From that we can differentiate whether its a COC/SOC and own units. own units no need to mention the lease type

Hence I proceeded with the approval in Lines module .... Subsequent to my approval we understand that in mundra location for Import Expenses all the entries were picked twice in the approved report... Total entries approved was 31 transactions. where as
in the agents system the approvedentries shown 62 and the total amount was exactly double the amount submitted for approval.

Ttl amount of expense submitted in Agents module

Export  - 63445
Import - 671720
General -234796
Where as the approved amount shown in Agents module is

Export  - 63445
Import - 1343440 ( exactly double the amount) ( Batch id GINOTHIMP30092019)
General -234796

Dear Olive,

For the subject bl we are unable to understand the Detention working against the Invoice no eBMS - Import Final Invoice - JAIIM18191000002 ... Please refer the below screen shot.

As there is no detention working available agianst the invoice , the container wise detention collection is not reflected in Detention collection report of Oct 2019 for Jaipur location.

May I know the reason for such problem and is the user is allowed to enter the consolidated amount of detention charges without updating the detention period.

Kindly look in to the matter.

Dear Nora,

Please advise how you are updating the moves of the containers in EBMS if its loaded from VNHPH.

Weve been doing most of the loading from HPH via PKL manually here in JEA for the past few weeks.

I spoke to EBMS and they said that PKL should create the loading vessel to JEA and nominate the vessel whenever doing the container entry for all
the T/S loading via PKL.

We cannot continue to always do it manually since we have EBMS system that we should use for all the loadings and also to prevent errors.

If you are encountering any problems, then you may contact EBMS directly or send email to Olive copy to us.

Dear KK / Olive,

We generated invoice no. MUNIM1911475788 (455454603) for INR.188863.54/= in ebms for freight and DTHC.

Later consignee requested to change the address in invoice.

We generated credit note no. MUNCR9892 (455454630) which got generated
with amount INR.176967.3/= instead of INR.188863.54/=

Kindly get the credit note rectified as we are getting querries from accounts team that there is short collection from consignee.

Please find attached copy of invoice and credit note for your ready reference.

You are also requested to rectify this error permanently as we have faced such issues previously also where freight is invoived.

Dear Mr. Olive,

As per telecom, pls find below screenshot in our Local eBMS system for our new line OMAN SHIPPING.
We are not able to generate BL draft.

We need your assistance and guidance.

Also, would request you to kindly keep the bl inputting simple since we will be using Principal system soon for BL issuance.

Points to be considered :

1. Draft BL to be saved without asking for proforma invoice since the proforma invoice module is in the GST section and the flow does not go directly.
2. Same final invoice too.
3. No approval tag for the BL - once inputted it should auto save and once customer approves it should be allowed for printing.
4. Presently we will be manually inputting theBL numbering - which pls let it remain the same way till the Principal system functions.

Attached sample of OMAN BL draft for setting purpose

Thanks
Vaishali

Dear KK,

Please note that a Standalone invoice opened / printed after it is digitally signed (ie. when it is opened from : V:\AME\DACS\ebms\prd folder ) it doesnt come in one page. It comes in two pages.
BUT if the same invoice if it is opened from ebms which is without digital signature it comes in one page. Sample Invoices of both such cases are attached for your reference.

Request you to check this issue and make such setup that digitally signed Standalone invoice also comes in one page.

Dear Olive Sir / KK Sir,

Good Day To You!!

With reference to Ticket ID No. E3087

Kindly remove container no. TLLU2159770 from BL No. INSG1923821
(Booking No. MUMU356668 ) and correct the invoice by taking quantity of 1 container.

Please map the above container, for which correct BL No. INSQ1923829booking MUMU356678

Looking for your feedback and positive support.

Thank you.

Good day Olive,

We wish to highlight AGAIN that shipments with additional FREE DETENTION DAYS,

ebms PICKs normal SLAB i/o Jumping DETENTION SLAB.

We clearly infomed to you many times and we are keep insiting that the DET tariff

should be on JUMPING SLAB, if additional free days applicable.

But ebms software is not making to that point.

Everytime, when we have shipments with additional free days, the PIC should check

manually whether ebms is picking up JUMPING SLAB, if not, then the person should

select JUMPING DETENTION tariff manually and arrange invoice to customer.

For this case, the EBMS missed to calculate DETENTION on JUMPING SLAB and our

PIC too missed to find the ebms error, before issuing invoice to customer.

we have a short collection on DETENTION charges of $ 340 for BL FGNS1909000546.

Now, we are trying to recover the same from consignee.

Please do look into this error and rectify the error to avoid future loss to our company.

Kindly advise.

Thanks & regards.,

maheswara

Dear All,

The Central Government is proposing to introduce an e-invoicing system, under which the enterprise resource planning (ERP) system of
businesses (beyond a certain threshold) would need to be linked to the government portal for generation of a unique invoice reference number (IRN), along with a QR code. 

Earlier, the government had released a concept note, a schema and a template for e-invoicing under GST which answered various questions on e-invoicing, including the proposed workflow. 

Pursuant to the same, as per various media reports, the government is looking to implement e-invoicing in multiple phases as detailed below: 

 S. No. 

Specifications 

Date of implementation 

Voluntary 

Mandatory 

 1 

Businesses with a turnover of INR 500 crore or more 

1 January 2020 

1 April 2020 

 2 

Businesses with a turnover of INR 100 crore or more 

1 February 2020 

1 April 2020 

 3 

Businesses with a turnover of less than INR 100 crore 

1 April 2020 

Yet to be prescribed 

As per the above table, it would be mandatory for businesses with a turnover of INR 100 crore and above to implement e-invoicing from 1 April 2020 onwards. 

Attached the following for easy understanding.

1) E-invoicing PPT from KPMG

2) E-invoice FAQ

3) eInvoice template

The Supplier ( HSDG)can generate the unique Invoice Reference Number (IRN) (in technical terms hash of 3 parameters as stated below, using
a standard and well known hash generation algorithm e.g. SHA256). This is an optional step. The seller can also generate this and upload along with invoice data. The 3 parameters which will be used to generate IRN (hash) are:

 i. Supplier
GSTIN,

 ii. Suppliers
invoice number and,

 iii. Financial
year (YYYY-YY). (The IRN or hash generation algorithm will be prescribed by GSTN in the enclosed e-invoice standard which specify that Max length of IRN is 50).
We have informed our IT in Hamburg. Meanwhile you can review and list out the challenges with regard to invoicing from
eBMS and eDAC transfer.

As conveyed to Anees yesterday, we have to comply with reporting of eBMS, to our IT in Hamburg. Roni will send the list
of the requirements and expect eBMS to implement the same in co-ordination with Roni.

Thanks & Regards

Dear Mr,. Olive/Mr,. Karuna,

Pls note that contr FCIU4838028 & TEMU1652349 were landed on 10/12/2019 & 11/12/2019 respectively and arrival date of vsl was updated 10/12/2019 in vsl schedule option

According to our Ops. team, arrival date seems to be changed automatically after updating last landing date of contr. As a result we are facing to generate detention invoice in case of more than one container in one BL.

In this case also (BL NO. ZHAY0816037), EBMS is not allowing us to generate detention invoice against one contr.

We need a permanent solution for this issue as it is difficult for us to check each and every case.

Pls see the below screen shotfor your ready ref...

Awaiting your reply.

Good day,

Where do we stand on this E-invoicing, we will be falling in this criteria and e invoicing will be mandatory for us ( incl SBMAPL + PMSPL + OSPL )

1. Introduction To E-Invoice Under GST

The GST Council approved the standard of e-invoice in its 37th meeting held on 20th Sept 2019 and accordingly, on 13th Dec 2019, Government has issued Notification No 68/2019 CT to 72/2019 CT, laying down legal roadmap for E-Invoicing. E-Invoicing
will be applicable on voluntary basis from January 2020 and mandatory from April 2020 to some class of person.

2. Misconception About E-Invoice Under GST

Biggest misconception about E-invoice, in the minds of GST Registered person / Professionals/ Consultant is that, E-Invoice means, preparing Tax invoice on GST Portal. Many people think that e-invoice will be generated from governments tax
portal. However, this is incorrect. Invoices will continue to be generated using an Accounting or billing software. Under E-Invoice, Invoice is prepared on ERP software and then JSON file from software will be created and that is required to be uploaded on
portal.

Another misconception about E-invoice is that, it is applicable to all GST Registered person. However as per Notification No 70/2019 CT dated 13th Dec 2019, it will be applicable

 To Registered person whose aggregate turnover in a financial year exceeds Rs 100 Crore and

 In respect of supply of Goods/Services to Registered Person (B2B)

3. E-Invoice Scheme

As per GSTIN, all accounting and billing software companies are being separately asked to adopt the e-invoice standard so that their users can generate the JSON from the software and upload the same on the IRP. All these software would adopt
the new e-Invoice standard wherein they would re-align their data access and retrieval in the standard format.

4. Benefits From E-Invoice under GST

Government envisaged below benefits from E-Invoice

Elimination of fake invoicesSubstantial reduction in input credit verification issuesOne time reporting on B2B invoice data, to reduce reporting in multiple formats (one for GSTR 1 or ANX 1 and the other for e-way bill)E-Way bill can also be generated using e-Invoice data

5. E-Invoice Portal [Invoice Registration Portal  (IRP)]

E-Invoice Portal [Invoice Registration Portal  (IRP)] is going to perform the following-

Generate a unique Invoice Reference Number (IRN)Digitally sign the e-invoiceGenerate a QR codeSend the signed e-invoice to the recipient of the document on the email provided in the e-invoice

6. Steps of Generation of E-Invoice under GST

STEP 1  Generation of Invoice and JSON

Generation of the invoice by the seller in his own accounting or billing system (it can be any software utility/ERP that generates invoice)The invoice must conform to the e-invoice (standards). Seller should have a feature in its ERP that will output invoice data in JSON format.Those who do not use any accounting software or IT tool to generate the invoice, will be provided an offline tool to key-in data of invoice and then submit the
sameThe suppliers (sellers) software should be capable to generate a JSON of the final invoice that is ready to be uploaded to the IRP. The IRP will only take JSON.

STEP 2  Uploading of JSON

Seller to upload the JSON of the e-invoice into the IRP.The JSON may be uploaded directly on the IRP or through GSPs or through third party provided Apps)

STEP 3  Validation of data by IRP

If IRN is not generated , then IRP will generate IRN, based on JSON uploaded.If IRN is generated, then IRP will validate the IRN, (Based on JSON uploaded) from Central Registry of GST System to ensure that the same invoice from the same
supplier pertaining to same Financial Year is not being uploaded again.On receipt of confirmation from Central Registry, IRP will add its signature on the Invoice Data as well as a QR code to the JSON.

STEP 4  Sharing of E-invoice

Sharing the signed E-invoice data along with IRN to sellerSharing the signed E-invoice data along with IRN to the GST System as well as to E-Way Bill System, will also update the ANX-1 of the seller and ANX-2 of the buyer.The IRP will sign the e-invoice and the e-invoice signed by the IRP will be a valid e-invoice and used by GST/E-Way bill system.

STEP 5

Returning the digitally signed JSON with IRN back to the seller along with a QRThe registered invoice will also be sent to the seller and buyer on their mail ids as provided in the invoice.

7. QR Code

The QR code will enable quick view, validation and access of the invoices from the GST system . It will be generated by IRP after uploading JSON of invoices. The QR code will consist of the following e-invoice parameters:

GSTIN of supplierGSTIN of RecipientInvoice number as given by SupplierDate of generation of invoiceInvoice value (taxable value and gross tax)Number of line items.HSN Code of main item (the line item having highest taxable value)Unique Invoice Reference Number.

8. Modes of Generation of E-Invoice under GST

Multiple modes will be made available so that taxpayer can use the best mode based on his/her need. The modes given below are envisaged at this stage under the proposed system for e-invoice, through the IRP (Invoice Registration Portal):

Web basedAPI basedSMS basedmobile app basedoffline tool based andGSP based.

9. Other Important points of E-Invoices under GST

Signature on E-invoice  E  invoice generated is not required to be signed again by the The e-invoice will be digitally signed by the IRP after it has been validated.
Once it is registered on IRP/GST System, it will not be required to be signed by anyone else.E-invoice Currency  Default currency of E-Invoice will be INR. Seller can display the currency in E-invoice.Line item of E-Invoices  The maximum number of line items per e-invoice is 100.Printing  E-invoice can be printed. It is valid only if it has IRN.Cancellation of E-Invoice  The e-invoice mechanism enables invoices to be cancelled. This will have to be reported within 24 hours. Any cancellation after 24hrs
could not be possible, however one can manually cancel the same on GST portal before filing the returns.E Way Bill  E-Invoice will not replace E-way bill. For transportation of goods, the e-way bill will continue to be mandatory

Dear Olive

Container number SEKU4014623 belongs to 2 B/Ls ( CULSHA19014736 and CULSHA19014735)

In above case, we need to collect all charges against 1st BL and only DO / HBL charges against 2nd BL (HBL only if HBL is involved). In this case there are 2 MBL so we will be collecting
only DO against 2nd BL.

We had collected all charges against BL CULSHA19014735 so we need to collect only DO fess against CULSHA19014736 but system is capturing few charges with quantity value 1 instead of 0.

Please check, rectify and confirm to us as we need to issue invoice to the customer

Hi KK/Olive,

For the below PBK, require the menu/tab as ""RCM -Car Hire Charges""under the Invoice Type.

As under this menu we don't want the input to be calculated for under GST, only output under RCM Payable needs to be calculated.

Since input is not allowed for Car Hire Charges hence, it would be convenientand better only RCM Payable needs to be captured under the PBK and not RCM input.

Hope am clear and contact me for any furtherclarification.

Thanks.
