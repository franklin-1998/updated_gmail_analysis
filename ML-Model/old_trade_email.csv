9/17/2016 6:38,postmaster@ebms.co.in,ranjith@ebms.co.in,"The ""Filtered Email"" folder and message processing","Hello Ranjith Kumar, 

This is a message informing you about Axigen's Identity Confirmation  capability. Please find more information below. 

Thank you,

The Postmaster 

What is this folder for?

""Filtered Email"" is a special folder, created by default, which will be used by Axigen's Identity Confirmation  service to temporarily store messages. The folder will be automatically populated with emails only if you decide to use this service.

What is Identity Confirmation?

Axigen's Identity Confirmation  service is basically a Challenge / Response anti-spam system designed to protect your Inbox from automated, unsolicited emails.

How does Identity Confirmation work?

Identity Confirmation ensures that you only have valid messages in your Inbox, messages that have been ""confirmed"" to be from REAL and legitimate senders.

The algorithm to achieve this is very simple:

A new person sends you an email message.
A new person sends you an email message.

it is considered unconfirmed and consequently placed in the ""Filtered Email"" folder, rather than your Inbox.
an instant reply message (confirmation request), containing an ""identification key"", is automatically generated towards the sender in question.

The sender only needs to reply to the confirmation request, while leaving the subject intact, as it contains the ""identification key"".
When this reply email from the sender arrives, his / her original email message is automatically moved from the ""Filtered Email"" folder to your Inbox and the response message is deleted.

How can I enable Identity Confirmation?

You can enable Axigen's Identity Confirmation  service from your WebMail interface, by going to the Settings -> AntiSpam section.

Tips before you start

Before you start using Identity Confirmation, you might want to consider whitelisting the email addresses from which you usually receive automated emails (e.g. newsletters or email-enabled Internet groups) so that they are skipped by this anti-spam system.
When Identity Confirmation is already enabled, you might also want to open the ""Filtered Email"" folder from time to time, just to check if you need to whitelist any addresses that you may have missed before.

For more information please visit http://www.axigen.com/identity-confirmation/",0

10-05-2016 09:16,ranjith@ebms.co.in,yunus@ebms.co.in,SHIPPING EXPORT FLOW,"Dear Team,

Please note that the below details for full shipping Export flow and
the same has been attached as a clear picture for easy understand.

Steps No

Description of Process Activity for a Typical Export Process

1

Buyer/Importer receives Shipping Advice from Overseas Exporter/Seller

2

Buyer/Importer receives Shipping Documents, including Bill of Lading and Commercial Invoice from Overseas Exporter/Seller

2a

In the case where Letter of Credit is involved in the transaction, Bank shall inform the Buyer/Importer when the set of documents has arrived from the Bank where the Overseas
Exporter/Seller has earlier nominated the payment of the goods against the Letter of Credit issued by the Buyer/Importer.

3

Carrier/Shipping Agent issues Arrival Notice of vessel wherein shipping charges payable are stated

3a

To prepare for the arrival of the vessel, the carrier/shipping agent submits a Status List <a document outlining the containers to be discharge> to the Port Terminal for the
operations planning.

3b

At the same time, the carrier/shipping agent submits the cargo manifest to the Customs to match against the Import Declarations.

4

Buyer/Importer issues Forwarding Instructions to his appointed Forwarding Agents, together with all the relevant shipping documents.

4a

Buyer/Importer informs the manufacturing plant or logistics warehouse on the estimated arrival of the goods.

5

Forwarding Agent submits the Import Declaration electronically to Customs using a software application, which after clearance is approved and if any customs duty or tax is
due, shall also be paid via electronic fund transfer by the forwarding agent.

5a

In cases where the customs clearance is dependent upon the approval of the OGA, the Forwarding Agent shall submit all relevant permit and document to the appropriate OGA for
their processing and inspection (if necessary). Once their processing is completed, the OGA would submit an electronic approval into the Customs SMK system.

5b

Customs, upon approving the Import Declaration, subject all other processes are completed, will issue a Release Status to the Port Terminal, which is permission for the Terminal
to release the container to the Forwarding Agent's appointed haulage company.

6

Forwarding Agent checks on the ETA or vessel with the carrier/shipping agent.

7

Forwarding Agent shall arrange for the exchange of the Original Bill of Lading for the Delivery Order, which is issued by the carrier/shipping electronically to the Port Terminal.
Any shipping charges payable shall be undertaken by the forwarding agent.

7a

The carrier/shipping agent submits the electronic Delivery Order to the Port Terminal.

8

Forwarding Agent applies to the Port Terminal for the Gate Pass. Gate Pass is issued to the Forwarding Agent and the issuance is done when the Customs has release the Hold
Status on the container. In all cases, the Forwarding Agent shall hold an active ledger account with the Terminal.

9

In parallel, the Forwarding Agent issues a Transport Order <Request for Transport> to the Container Haulage Company to pick up the container from the Terminal for delivery
to the Importer/Buyer. In the submission of the order, a copy of the delivery order and the gate pass are also handed over, as these documents are required proof of the authorization for pickup. However, with the Port Klang Net system operating in Q3 2013,
the usage of such paper documents would be eliminated, thus expediting the process and saving manpower resources.

10

Upon receipt of the transport order, the haulage company will on the availability of their truck against the required delivery date before confirming the acceptance of the
order, as the date of delivery is usually stated in the order.

11

The haulage company will proceed to the terminal to pick up the said container.

11a

Once the container leaves the gate of the terminal, an electronic <Gate-Out> message is sent to the carrier/shipping agent.

12

The haulage company will deliver the said container to the address of the manufacturing plant or logistics warehouse, stated in the transport order.

13

The manufacturing plant/logistics warehouse informs the Buyer/Importer (or the forwarding agent) that the goods have been unloaded and request that the empty container be
return to the carrier/shipping agent's nominated empty container depot.

14

The Importer/Buyer informs accordingly to the Forwarding Agent to return the empty container.

15

The Forwarding Agent, in turn instructs the haulage company to return the empty container.

16

The empty container is picked up by the haulage company for return to the nominated depot.

17

The empty container is duly returned to the nominated depot.

17a

Once the empty container is returned to the nominated depot, an electronic message is sent to the carrier/shipping agent confirming the details.

17b

The Proof of Delivery (POD) is submitted to the forwarding agent

18

The Forwarding Agent raises his Bill of Services, outlining all the various charges he has paid on before (disbursements) and his professional fees, for submission to the
Importer/Buyer. He returns also all the relevant shipping documents he has receive in the beginning from the Importer/Buyer.

10-07-2016 07:10,ranjith@ebms.co.in,fahad@ebms.co.in,Re: Shipping Functionality Required,"Dear Fahad,

Pls find as your requested details for import circle.

combine export and import these two only the flow of shipping.

still you need anything pls revert..

Steps No

Description of Process Activity for a Typical Import Process 

1

Buyer/Importer receives Shipping Advice from Overseas Exporter/Seller

2

Buyer/Importer receives Shipping Documents, including Bill of Lading and Commercial Invoice from Overseas Exporter/Seller

2a

In the case where Letter of Credit is involved in the transaction, Bank shall inform the Buyer/Importer when the set of
documents has arrived from the Bank where the Overseas Exporter/Seller has earlier nominated the payment of the goods against the Letter of Credit issued by the Buyer/Importer.

3

Carrier/Shipping Agent issues Arrival Notice of vessel wherein shipping charges payable are stated

3a

To prepare for the arrival of the vessel, the carrier/shipping agent submits a Status List <a document outlining the containers
to be discharge> to the Port Terminal for the operations planning.

3b

At the same time, the carrier/shipping agent submits the cargo manifest to the Customs to match against the Import Declarations.

4

Buyer/Importer issues Forwarding Instructions to his appointed Forwarding Agents, together with all the relevant shipping
documents.

4a

Buyer/Importer informs the manufacturing plant or logistics warehouse on the estimated arrival of the goods.

5

Forwarding Agent submits the Import Declaration electronically to Customs using a software application, which after clearance
is approved and if any customs duty or tax is due, shall also be paid via electronic fund transfer by the forwarding agent.

5a

In cases where the customs clearance is dependent upon the approval of the OGA, the Forwarding Agent shall submit all relevant
permit and document to the appropriate OGA for their processing and inspection (if necessary). Once their processing is completed, the OGA would submit an electronic approval into the Customs SMK system.

5b

Customs, upon approving the Import Declaration, subject all other processes are completed, will issue a Release Status to
the Port Terminal, which is permission for the Terminal to release the container to the Forwarding Agent's appointed haulage company.

6

Forwarding Agent checks on the ETA or vessel with the carrier/shipping agent.

7

Forwarding Agent shall arrange for the exchange of the Original Bill of Lading for the Delivery Order, which is issued by
the carrier/shipping electronically to the Port Terminal. Any shipping charges payable shall be undertaken by the forwarding agent.

7a

The carrier/shipping agent submits the electronic Delivery Order to the Port Terminal.

8

Forwarding Agent applies to the Port Terminal for the Gate Pass. Gate Pass is issued to the Forwarding Agent and the issuance
is done when the Customs has release the Hold Status on the container. In all cases, the Forwarding Agent shall hold an active ledger account with the Terminal.

9

In parallel, the Forwarding Agent issues a Transport Order <Request for Transport> to the Container Haulage Company to pick
up the container from the Terminal for delivery to the Importer/Buyer. In the submission of the order, a copy of the delivery order and the gate pass are also handed over, as these documents are required proof of the authorization for pickup. However, with
the Port Klang Net system operating in Q3 2013, the usage of such paper documents would be eliminated, thus expediting the process and saving manpower resources.

10

Upon receipt of the transport order, the haulage company will on the availability of their truck against the required delivery
date before confirming the acceptance of the order, as the date of delivery is usually stated in the order.

11

The haulage company will proceed to the terminal to pick up the said container.

11a

Once the container leaves the gate of the terminal, an electronic <Gate-Out> message is sent to the carrier/shipping agent.

12

The haulage company will deliver the said container to the address of the manufacturing plant or logistics warehouse, stated
in the transport order.

13

The manufacturing plant/logistics warehouse informs the Buyer/Importer (or the forwarding agent) that the goods have been
unloaded and request that the empty container be return to the carrier/shipping agent's nominated empty container depot.

14

The Importer/Buyer informs accordingly to the Forwarding Agent to return the empty container.

15

The Forwarding Agent, in turn instructs the haulage company to return the empty container.

16

The empty container is picked up by the haulage company for return to the nominated depot.

17

The empty container is duly returned to the nominated depot.

17a

Once the empty container is returned to the nominated depot, an electronic message is sent to the carrier/shipping agent
confirming the details.

17b

The Proof of Delivery (POD) is submitted to the forwarding agent

18

The Forwarding Agent raises his Bill of Services, outlining all the various charges he has paid on before (disbursements)
and his professional fees, for submission to the Importer/Buyer. He returns also all the relevant shipping documents he has receive in the beginning from the Importer/Buyer.
